# Skilled Landing Page

A responsive landing page built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
The design showcases a modern responsive layout with a hero section, course highlights, and a footer. This project is a solution to the [Skilled e-learning landing page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/skilled-elearning-landing-page-S1ObDrZ8q) on Frontend Mentor.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: Tailwindâ€™s responsive utilities ensure the page adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- **Reusable Components**: Page is broken down into modular React components (Hero, CourseCard, HighlightCard, Footer).
- **Icons as Components**: Custom SVG icons extracted and wrapped as standalone React components for reusability.
- **Optimized Images**: Images are provided in the modern **WebP format**, always in two versions (`image.webp` and `image@2x.webp`). The browser automatically chooses the most suitable resolution.

## Key Learnings

- **Tailwind Basics & Customization**: Strengthened knowledge of Tailwind utilities for layout, spacing, sizing, and responsive design.
- **Component Structure in React**: Gained practice in splitting the UI into modular and reusable components.
- **SVG to JSX Conversion**: Converted inline SVGs into React + Tailwind-friendly JSX syntax.
- **Working With Assets**: Learned to optimize images with WebP and handle multiple resolutions (`1x` and `2x`).
- **Icons as Props/Data**: Stored icon components inside data arrays and rendered them dynamically in React components.
